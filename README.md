# Linkage mapping reveals loci that underlie differences in C. elegans growth
 
Growth rate and body size are integral and complex traits that contribute to the fitness of organisms. The identification of loci that underlie differences in these traits provide insights into the genetic contributors to development. Leveraging *Caenorhabditis elegans* as a tractable metazoan model for quantitative genetics, we can identify genetic regions that underlie differences in growth. We measured post-embryonic growth of the wild type strain (N2) and a natural isolate from Hawaii (CB4856), and found differences in body size. Using linkage mapping, we identified three distinct quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome IV, V, and X that are associated with variation in body size. We further examined these size-associated QTL using chromosome substitution strains and near-isogenic lines, and validated the chromosome X QTL. Additionally, we generated a list of candidate genes identified in *C. elegans* for the chromosome X QTL. These genes could potentially contribute to differences in animal growth and should be evaluated in the future. Our work reveals the genetic architecture underlying animal growth and highlights the genetic complexity of body shape in the developing *C. elegans*.
